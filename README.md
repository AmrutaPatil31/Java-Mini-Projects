This repository contains multiple Java projects that I built by following tutorials from the Code Bro YouTube channel
.
The main purpose of these projects is practice and learning â€“ to understand how real-world Java projects are structured and how to apply different concepts of Java step by step.

<h1>Objectives</h1>h:
